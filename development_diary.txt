Discussed in class the scope of the project. Determined that it would be completely local. 
Considered adding GUI or keeping it as a terminal application, as well as how placing ships
would work on a console
* chose coordinate of first square of a ship, then horizontal or vertical and it will be placed, provided
  there is enough space, otherwise it would return an error message and promt to try again.

Checked out Löve, a 2d lua game engine, and added it to our considerations for writing our game.

Worked with the luaunit test framework, couldn't figure out how the hell to get tests working, but the
plan was to initialize a board as a 2d array with all 0s, and the test would check the values
