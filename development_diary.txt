Discussed in class the scope of the project. Determined that it would be completely local. 
Considered adding GUI or keeping it as a terminal application, as well as how placing ships
would work on a console
* chose coordinate of first square of a ship, then horizontal or vertical and it will be placed, provided
  there is enough space, otherwise it would return an error message and promt to try again.

Checked out Löve, a 2d lua game engine, and added it to our considerations for writing our game.

Worked with the luaunit test framework, couldn't figure out how the hell to get tests working, but the
plan was to initialize a board as a 2d array with all 0s, and the test would check the values

2/24/16:
Spent ~ an hour and a half pair programming with Lonney, got the board drawing with values in it for ships.
Also wrote a test for placing a ship and got it to pass.
Set up states for the game(not complete by any stretch), added a tracker for the mouse, did some display formating
set up constants for easy maintenence and continued development, did... some other stuff, I should have been
keeping track.
