1: Opened the game and when I tried to place my ships they didn't show up
even though it said they were placed

2: Played halfway through a game, but then I left and when I came back a while
later the game was too laggy to finish playing

3: Started the game but the graphics weren't pretty enough so I want a refund

4: BEST GAME EVER! I absolutely love battleship, and this imagining of it is a
breath of fresh air for the franchise. The retro visuals bring me back to my childhood
where this game on paper was the only thing I had to entertain myself, and the game mechanics
and controls are, pardon the pun, water tight! All in all I think this game
is a sure winner of game of the year and everyone should do themselves a favor
and pick it up as soon as possible. 11/10 stars!
